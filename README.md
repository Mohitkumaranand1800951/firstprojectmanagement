GitHubâ€™s project management features, like milestones, issues, and project boards, enhance team collaboration and project organization by providing a structured and transparent workflow. Milestones help track high-level goals, ensuring the team stays focused on priorities and deadlines. Issues centralize task management, allowing teams to document bugs, features, or feedback, assign ownership, and facilitate discussions in one place. Project boards provide a visual overview of progress using a customizable Kanban-style interface, making it easy to track tasks from "To Do" to "Done." With integration options, automation through GitHub Actions, and clear accountability, these tools streamline communication, improve task tracking, and help teams deliver projects efficiently.
